# practice
Miscellaneous practice and test code. Hopefully also acts as a portfolio to show that I can at least code half-decently to any potential employers.

Projects included:
1. Fizz-Buzz
  "Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
  For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
  For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
  For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number."
